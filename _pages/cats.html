<p>Its long been debated as to the best thing to do when getting started building a website. Optimize your content? Tweak the design? No, of course not! The only correct option is to flood it with as many cat pictures as humanly possible. After all, what’s the internet without an abundance of <b>Food In Poop Out (FIPO)</b> critters hapazardly uploaded to its every corner? 

Let’s be honest, nothing engages our shrinking attention span like a gallery of cats doing absolutely nothing. In this spirit, here are a few snapshots of my very own FIPOs.</p> 

<img src="/assets/images/cats/1.jpg" alt="catpic1""> 

<p> Meet Kipper (grey) and Gillbert (salt-and-pepper). When this photo was taken, Kipper was 11 months and Gillbert was 4 months</p>

<img src="/assets/images/cats/2.jpg" alt="catpic2""> 

<p>Kipper and Gillberts names both stem from a fish theme, dispite the fact that fish is a rare treat for cats in the wild. Kippers are a "traditional dish produced by cold-smoking Atlantic herring over wooden oak chips" and Gillberts namesake being... Gill... from a fish. </p>
