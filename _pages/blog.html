<p><b>This is a picture of Lukes bald ass head.</b></p> 
<p>He was 18 when he went bald. Male pattern baldness is a real issue.</p>

<p> 
  Luke aspired to be the next Steve Jobs, envisioning himself unveiling groundbreaking gadgets while donning a signature black turtleneck. However, fate had other plans. As his early-onset male pattern baldness progressed, his dreams seemed to recede faster than his hairline.
Instead of brainstorming the next iPhone, Luke found solace in Counter-Strike skin gambling websites. Nights were spent furiously dumping thousands of dollars away in hopes of obtaining something over $0.03 in value. In an attempt to make some of his money back, luke logged onto rustypot.com for case-battles, only to be mercilessly pounded by teenagers with usernames like "xX_HairSnatcher_Xx". 
</p> 

<p>
  Seeking camaraderie, Luke stumbled upon a Steam group named "Submissive Groupchat". Thinking it was a community for humble gamers, he joined eagerly. To his surprise (and mild horror), the discussions weren’t about game strategies unless "how to properly kneel before your gaming chair" counted. One particularly enthusiastic member suggested, "Maybe Luke's hair left because it couldn't handle his dominant gaming skills." 
In response, Luke held the power button down on his computer.
</p>

<p>
  In an effort to reclaim some masculinity and escape his digital misadventures, Luke took up a new hobby he heard about on the Joe Rogan podcast: "Fishing for hogs". Imagining serene mornings by the lake, rod in hand, he was instead introduced to the wild world of feral hog hunting. Armed with nothing but a flimsy fishing rod and misguided confidence, Luke ventured into the woods.
Moments later, townsfolk witnessed a naked bald man sprinting down the street, chased by an irate hog. It was a sight to behold. Some say the gleam from his head blinded the beast temporarily, allowing Luke a narrow escape. Others whispered that the hog took offense at Luke's abrupt departure from the Steam "Submissive Groupchat" and comments about the nearby lakes water quality.

<p>
Breathless and disheveled, Luke wrote a tragic poem about his story:

    <p><b>The Bald Dreamer’s Lament</b></p>
    <p>Luke dreamed of turtlenecks, of tech and fame,</p> 
    <p>But fate was cruel, and stole his mane.</p> 
    <p>No iPhones to craft, no Jobs to become,</p> 
    <p>Just a bald head, and a future undone.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>He gambled online, his hopes ran dry,</p> 
    <p>Skins and dreams vanished with each try.</p> 
    <p>In search of kin, he found only shame,</p> 
    <p>In a group that mocked his very name.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>He fled to the woods, but reality struck,</p> 
    <p>A feral hog came and gave him a fuck</p> 
    <p>Now left with nothing, only a rod in his hand</p> 
    <p>Once more betrayed by death of folical strands.</p>

<p>If you sympathize with Lukes story, you can trade me counterstrike skins to help fight early onset male pattern baldness. </p>
